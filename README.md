## Employers 

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## Process
```
* 1. started html code and build the structure from top to bottom.

* 2. As I  was building the html structure I was making sure that I used semantic/accessability practices

* 3. Created two css files, one to reset browser initial properties and the second one to style the html

* 4. for this project I decided to use Flex box as much as possible, as well as variables, child selector.

* 5. in the css I broke it in to section, from top to bottom.
as I finished a section I would move to the next.

* 6. I try to use as descriptive class names and if possible i used the element in html

* 7. As i move down I started to notice all the variables I kept reusing and made one for each term that i kept using.

* 8. When Finish styling css, I started to make the site useable from many platforms as possible, as the size of the screen when down, I slowly started moving percentages,ratios and font sizes down.
